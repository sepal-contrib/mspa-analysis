## About 

Module to perform MSPA analysis in the Sepal platform. The user will select a file of his choice and create its own binary map. This binary map will be used as input file of the MSPA tool. The parameters can be tuned by the user to fit its requirements.  
Note that all the output files are in EPSG:4326.

### Background info on MSPA
MSPA (Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis) is a customized sequence of mathematical morphological operators targeted at the description of the geometry and connectivity of the image components. Based on geometric concepts only, this methodology can be applied at any scale and to any type of digital images in any application field.
